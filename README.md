Written by Niklas Roslund and Wiljam Wilmi

Parts of the code have been omitted.
The project will still run fine but it will not give the same results.

To run the project, all of the libraries under the imports section need to be installed in your Python environment.
You will also need to install ollama, if you have a GPU it will run faster through a docker container. Instructions for this is outlined in this article: https://ollama.com/blog/ollama-is-now-available-as-an-official-docker-image

The model is preset to mistral:instruct, changing the model is done by changing the name in the code.
