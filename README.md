RAG implementation for analysis of sustainability reports
Written by Niklas Roslund and Wiljam Wilmi

Some code has been omitted.
The code should still run but it will not give the same results.

To run this you need to install all libraries under imports
You will also need to install ollama, if you have a GPU it will run faster through a docker container
Then run your desired model, it is preset to mistral:instruct
Changing the model is done by changing the name in the code where it says mistral:instruct to maybe Gemma or Llama
